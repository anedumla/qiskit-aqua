    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactor the Linear_solvers package, so that the quantum algorithm (HHL) accepts oracles for the different blocks and computes de different parameters according to the error bounds calculated in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of the algorithm can be created by specifying the error tolerance, the problem to be solved is only specified when the `solve()` method is called:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit.aqua.algorithms.linear_solvers.hhl import HHL\n",
    "\n",
    "# initialise the algorithm\n",
    "hhl = HHL(epsilon=1e-3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve()` method accepts three arguments: the matrix defining the linear system, the vector right hand side of the equation (i.e. writing $Ax=b$, respectively $A$ and $b$), and the (list of) observable(s) to be computed out of the solution vector $x$. The latter is required because the output of the quantum algorithm is a quantum state representing the vector $x$, however to learn all the components of this vector would take a linear time in its dimension diminishing any speedup obtained by the quantum algorithm. Thus, we can only compute functions from $x$ (the so called observables) to learn information about the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to specify $A$. Intuitively, it can be specified as a numpy array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = [[1/2, -2], [-2, 1/2]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we know how to implement $e^{iAt}$, we can also give this circuit as an input. The circuit needs to be able to accept $t$ as a parameter, since this parameter will be specified within HHL. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit.circuit.library.blueprintcircuit import BlueprintCircuit\n",
    "class MatrixCircuit(BlueprintCircuit):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, num_state_qubits, name='mcirc'):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name=name)\n",
    "        self.num_state_qubits = num_state_qubits\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def _build(self, evo_time=1):\n",
    "        # build code\n",
    "        \n",
    "matrix = MatrixCircuit(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix can also be specified as an operator\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = (-1.05 * I) + (0.39 * Z) + (0.18 *  X) \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input vector\n",
    "\n",
    "HHL also accepts different types for the vector. Again, it can be specified as a numpy array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vector = [1, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or as a circuit\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit import QuantumCircuit\n",
    "\n",
    "vector = QuantumCircuit(1)\n",
    "vector.h(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input observable\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of available observables which can be given as input:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit.aqua.algorithms.linear_solvers.observables import EuclideanNorm, AbsoluteAverage, ExpectedValue,\\\n",
    "MatrixFunctional\n",
    "\n",
    "observables = [EuclideanNorm(), AbsoluteAverage(), ExpectedValue()]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `MatrixFunctional` class takes a matrix for its constuctor method, which can also be specified as a numpy array or a quantum circuit.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "observables.append(MatrixFunctional([[1,2],[2,1]]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these variables are specified, we can run the algorithm and obtain the calculated value for each observable:\n",
    "However some observables will depend on the dimension of the system, which ideally one only specifies once `hhl.solve` is called. Therefore, we could allow to add observables from this method as well.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# run the algorithm and add an observable which depends on the dimension \n",
    "result = hhl.solve(matrix=matrix, vector=vector, observable=observables)\n",
    "\n",
    "# array with the calculated values for each observable\n",
    "observable_values = result.value\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
